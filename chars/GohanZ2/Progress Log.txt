- Removed the last Saiyaman voice from his vs Freeza intro.
- "Flying away" winpose only during the last round.
- Startup on throws reduced to 3 ticks, and recovery time set up to 18 ticks.
- Increased recovery time on Ki Blast (1st and 2nd) to avoid a Ki Blast infinite (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_dy6k_meA&feature=youtu.be)
- Divekick Flurry super cancelled slightly late into Hurricane Kick should now connect correctly with P2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEOf8_ZPX0k&feature=youtu.be)
- Fixed a bug where opponent would restand if Masenko juggled low enough.
- Added Dramatic/Dissolve SFX to Fatality 1.
- Emo Chou Masenko Up has the travelling lightning FX.
- Finisher 3 : the twirling beams start going up a little sooner, so it's less obvious that they do.
- When you catch P2 in the air with Unleashed Gekiretsu Ranbu, made it so P2 would hit the ground during the move (didn't manage having P2 standing at all times).
- Removed all code for Beam Collision.
- Updated sprites : for standing Medium Kick, Air Punch Zero Counter, completely new sprite for the last frame of his 2nd Ki Blast throw, the first frame of his idle animation.
- My Toes! animation.
- Updated finisher 3 with new improved Beam+Twirl animation.

- Added noFG, noBG, noBarDisplay to fatality states.
- Added a voice when emo bar is full.
- Changed the Videl palette and one SSJ palette.

- Fixed a bug in the basics limiter to avoid this type of combos on tall chars : http://youtu.be/yymJvlA5nhw ([jump, LK or LP, LK, HK, land] repeat)
- Can't airguard anymore if jumping forward or if you have air dashed (fix by Websta in Freeza).
- Replaced certain sprites with others and edited some anims to Balthazar's wishes :
	+ Group change 1 :
		* Kamehameha stop launching 004
		* Jump start frame
		* winpose 1 (facebook) first frame
		* Taunt first frame
		^ all of the above is to be replaced with : Henshin transformation (old save) [Group 900 - Begin Action 18250]
	+ Crouch Turning 002 : Can this frame simply be removed? 001 > 002 looks weird as fuck with the legs being static, it's supposed to be only 001 and 003, really. If it HAS to be 3 frames, I'll make a pair of new legs for 002 so it animates better.
	+ Gohan in car [Group 194]
	+ Time Over 001 > to be replaced with: Cheap KO / Collapse Anim 001
	+ Jump Down Medium Punch End 002 + Jump Strong Punch 014 (shared sprite)
	+ Soaring Dragon Strike start-up 002 [Group 2110]
	+ Soaring Dragon Strike dash 002 + 003 [Group 2100]
	+ SDS on ground 001 [Group 2110]+ Finisher 1 - teleport & gut punch 003 (shared sprite)
	+ Group change 2 :
		* standing Medium Kick 006, 007 and 008
		* standing close Medium Kick 007, 008 and 010
		* standing combo Medium Kick 009, 010 and 012
		^ these are the same three sprites for all three animations described above.
	+ Wheel Kick Mega - frame 018 (last frame)
	+ standing Medium Punch 001 + gekiretsu, 4th punch (shared sprite)
	+ Jump strong punch 001 > to be replaced with: Jump light punch 001
	+ Zero Counter punch 001 > to be replaced with: Standing Strong Kick 002
	+ Omni Kick Forward 001 > to be replaced with: Air Zero Counter Kick 001
	+ Weak/Medium/Strong Hurricane Kick 001 + 002 > to be replaced with: Standing Zero Counter Kick 001 + 002
	+ Light Soaring Dragon Kick 009
	+ Strong Soaring Dragon Kick 016 + 017
	+ gekiretsu, 3rd kick 004 > to be replaced with: Kick Counter 004 [Group 752]
	+ Omni Kick Up 001 by new Strong Soaring Kick 016
- Added Bardock outift to Kibito intro
- Fixed Finisher 3 bug when on far right of the stage.

UPDATE 1 :
- AI added by Infinite !!!
- Updated woosh LK (0,3) / woosh SP (0,2) / impact SP (5,2) sounds.
- Added some winquotes to Gohan

====================================================

NEW MOVES (not for now) :
- Should he get a ground version for his Super Hurricane Kick? It would act the same as Akuma's in SF3 (he rises straight into the air while spinning, basicly).
- Saiyaman sentai posing : I think they'll be nice for his Perfect KO. The other Perfect KO winpose I had in mind was that Trunks' time machine would appear, and Future Gohan would come out.
- Oh I also still think it would be cool if he got the Lv3 Masenko, kind of like an alternative, in-game Finisher move to blow your bar on. It would just use the sprites and sounds from his Finisher 1 Masenko, and work like his in-game Chou Kamehameha. Perhaps even both a horizontal and a diagonal version. You would be able to perform this move only with a fully-charged Emo bar. I think for that one you can pretty much just copy the Chou Kamehameha code and replace the sprites. Same for the diagonal version which I think it should also get.


DUNNO OR LATER :
- Alright this was weird. I came at Freeza with a Lv1 Soaring Dragon Strike, and he kicked me, we traded hits. But then, both players LAUNCHED INTO SPACE superfast! after about 5 seconds, both came falling back down. Don't know what that was all about!
? still has the alignment jump after he jumps out of is car (in the car with videl intro), to his idle.
? in the intro, I've seen a 'version' of it where there is no speech from Gohan at all, an oversight?
[NOT FOR NOW] About Finisher 3, could you be persuaded to cut out the launcher kick > butterfly segment, and just have him do the spinning wing kick instead of the launcher kick, leading straight into the team Kamehameha? It would speed things up a bit and still look as cool as it does now.
[MEEEEHHH !!!!] Ranbu : It must have some sort of built-in scaler that lowers the damage each time it's used. Going into Training Mode, the first time I pulled it off it did about 390 damage, which seems fair. Doing it a second time, it only did about 250 damage. The third time, only about 150. The 4th time it only did about 50 damage.
? Infinite #2: [Super jump, down dash, a.LP, land] repeat   : http://youtu.be/ezlWnE4Od9k   ([Down, diagonal up-forward (or up),  down, down (really damn fast! Delay long enough to make sure the LP will actually come out) LP at the same time as the second down input, land]) - Not fixed for now because impossible to perform in a real fight.
? When attacking p2 when he's dizzy from the Masenko, it will reset the combo counter...then what's the point !?
? I activated his Lv2 Masenko, and Freeza Z2 did his ground headbutt, somehow I was able to block it (?), but the background did go black (for the superpause). This was a bit weird. I don't really know what happened tbh!


FEEDBACK :

- I can't do this intentionally, but sometimes one of the ground hitting fx of the aerial Chou Kamehameha show up in midair.
- A bug involving the ground dizzy state causing ground normals to whiff based on juggle point values. If Gohan does a combo involving a move that would add juggle points (opponent in air already, then a move with a juggle value), ground-based moves will add juggle and eventually whiff on the ground:  http://youtu.be/9V-TOuJdb4I

- videl car intro battling with gohan. to do this glitch, you need to hear the startup engine on the car, then press CTRL+I and there you go. 
- censored gohan. if gohan is with kibito, press CTRL+I and Gohan is censored.
