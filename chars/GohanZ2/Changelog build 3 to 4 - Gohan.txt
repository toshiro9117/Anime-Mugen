=Added double bounce per combo (once from jSP and once from a downward Omni Kick (aerial db, d or df+SK).

=Reduced enemy pushback on Ki Blasts (both normal and EX versions).

=Added poweradd for the Diving Flurry Kick (he gains power when performing it, even if he doesn't hit).
=Diving Kick Flurry now also gives power to the Unleashed Bar when in Unleashed Mode.
=EX Diving Flurry Kick will not give power back.
=EX version now causes a ground bounce.
=Added chains for the landing state of EX Diving Kick Flurry: 
 Lvl2 Super Kamehameha, Lvl 2 Masenko, Lvl 2 Soaring Dragon Strike.

=Made the Weak and Medium versions of Hurricane Kick quicker and invincible at the start up.
=Modified gravity of the Hurricane Kicks (EX version included) to show the entire animation of the attack.
=Removed aura graphics from EX Hurricane Kicks (both straight and rising).
=Rising Hurricane Kick Medium version second kick knocks up opponent higher enough so that 
 when you punish someone in the air with it you can combo into another Rising Hurricane Kick.

 You'll see when you perform the medium and strong versions.

=s.LP -> Lvl1 Masenko combo possible (with good timing).
=Lvl 2 Masenkos are unblockable.
=Buffed damage for Lvl2 Masenko.
=Returned Dizzy attributes of Masenko back to what they were, 
 near instant BUT now it won't dizzy if the opponent is in a hit state when he begins the move.

=New Lvl2 Masenko is similar to Lvl1 version with more hits and damage.
=Moved Spark Masenko to Unleashed mode with extended hitbox.
=Fixed an issue with comboing Ki Blasts into Lvl2 Masenko.

=Earlier active counter frames (2 ticks instead of 6) on base Gekiretsu Ranbu.
=Activation command for Ranbu is QCB,f+K
=Ranbu damage damper now works as intended.
=A little oversight has been fixed, regarding the amount of Super Moves and EX moves you can do in Destiny mode.

=Reduced damage scaling on Super Hurricane Kick, Chou Kamehameha and Soaring Dragon Strike (Lvl1 and 2) from combos.

=The j.SP that leads to the Gekiretsu Ranbu finishers won't kill the enemy if the right conditions are met.
=Fixed the issue of the Bro Kamehameha (Finisher 3) coming out when Unleashed bar was below the Lvl1 threshold.
=Nerfed damage of the Ranbu.
=The command for Gekiretsu Ranbu is now QCB,F,any kick.

=Emotion system now definitely called 'Destiny Mode' (we forgot whether it was Destiny or Unleashed mode).
=Emotion system edited so the effects (dust, lightning) don't move when in superpause.
=Replaced spark effects during Unleashed Mode power charge.
=Destiny Mode Activation command is changed to d,d+MP+MK.
=EX Special Moves don't drain from the Destiny Bar anymore. Instead they drain from the Power Bar as usual,
 however they only cost 1/4 of 1 Power Bar stock instead of 1/2.
=He can now do up to 3 LVL1 or LVL2 supers in emo mode before he leaves it. 
 Seemed odd that LVL2 added more and needed twice as much emo meter to fire.
=Nerfed the damage of the Finishers, adjusted accordingly.

=updated small portraits.
=Added new wall bounce effect.
=Slash Chop yellow effects removed.
=Dizzy stars moved 30 pixels upwards for Piccolo.
=The power charge action now uses the mouth explods.
=Facebook winpose bugs (kind of fixed, we worked around that)
=Fixed intros: Bicycle and Car Crash: while landing Gohan usually ended up move a bit to the left or to the right 
 depending on the stage you were on; to fix this I made Gohan invisible for 1 tick, 
 set the fvar(29) as the original Pos x, then added 1 tick to the other state controllers to make the intro/s work.
 The fixes were added into state 19200 (system.cns) and state 52 (override.cns).


=Added alternate costume, courtesy of Chamat and Ethan the Human.
 To use it, go to the 'chars' folder and rename the 'GohanZ2' folder to 'GohanZ2Alternate'.
 Next, go inside the 'data' folder and open the 'select' file using a .txt program.
 Find 'GohanZ2' and change it to 'GohanZ2Alternate', then save the file. Then run HyperDBZ.
 If you did all the steps correctly, the alternate costumed Gohan will be available.
