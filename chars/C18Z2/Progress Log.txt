NOTES ON EMO MODE
- Power Charge is disabled. No power is gained from hitting the enemy or performing moves
- EMO Bar fills automatically from time to time, indicating the current MAX threshold
- Each EX or Hyper move will consume no power bar, but instead use the EMO bar, reducing it
- If the EMO bar reaches 0, Eighteen will enter into "Overheat" mode
- In Overheat mode, she could still perform EX/hyper moves, but at the risk of breaking her energy core.
- In Overheat mode, the maximum threshold is lost
- If the energy core is broken, she will lose EMO mode and go into a dizzy state
- Level of the finisher will be determined by the current EMO level charge (not the threshold)


NOTES ON EMO EXIT MODE
- Increased speed thanks to her infinite energy core. Her moves will play out a 50% faster
- Basics can be chained without limitation
- Afterimages will also hit the enemy
- Performing a Throw, an EX move or a Hyper will end the mode
- Getting hit or blocking an attack will end the mode
- Duration of the mode depends on the EMO bar MAX threshold (not the current EMO charge)
