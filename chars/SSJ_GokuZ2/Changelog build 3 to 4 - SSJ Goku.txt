=Reduced life to 900.
=The AI will not go into Justice Mode while charging power.
=AI was able to perform cr.MP > st.MK. Feature removed.
=Hitsparks converted from explods to sparkno and sparkxy.
=P2StateNo converted to TargetState in all cns files.
=added two ticks of no control in the landing state;
=Converted pausetimes from WinMugen to Mugen 1.0.
=Put TargetState instead of p2stateno.
=Timer freezes during Ultimate moves.
=Added two ticks of no control in the landing state.
=Fixed Zero Counter start up animation.
=New damage dampener added.
=All varsets (var(7)) in all states that require it are now fixed (a.HP / a.HK bounce juggle limit).
=Quick workaround for Piccolo's clones and Saibamen implemented 
 (he will do a strong Blast Fist  against them instead of the Shin Shoryuken).
=Readjusted dmg on ALL super and finishers.
=fixed the minimum dmg issues with his LVL3 finishers. 

=Added recovery time to Focus Attack.
=s.SP now uncancellable until the last hit. Also, more time recovery added on the last hit.
=The cr.SK is some ticks slower than before. Adjusted codes for statetypesets, y positions, etc. .
=Teleport -> Blast Fist (shoryuken) loop combo shortened by a lot.
 After a Blast Fist you can teleport twice if in Justice mode, once if not.
=Added ability to cancel after coming down from EX Blast Fist.
=Removed height restriction from EX Dive Kick and added it to normal Dive Kick.

=Increased start-up of teleports.
=Teleports now cost 500 meter unless you teleport while P2 is blocking. Then it costs 1000 meter.
=If P2 is in a hitstate while you teleport your super meter will fill up half as fast till P2 recovers.
=While in Justice mode, Teleport Attacks do NOT cause the super meter reduction. Just the teleports that leave you ctrl.
=When you exit emo mode due to any teleport you also lose 1000 super meter. 
 These nerfs were added to prevent people from using Justice Mode to build meter super fast 
 and then go straight into Justice Mode again.
=Doing a teleport ads 1 point to your damage dampener.
=Made an alternative way to do teleports with QCB+attack.

=cr.SK -> Air Kamehameha (lv1 and lvl2) combo link added.
=Lvl 1 Kamehameha does 8 hits now instead of 10.

=Sonic Rush LVL1 and 2 deal more damage.

=The Super Kamehameha effects now play during pause/superpause.
=Fixed Air Super Kame by adding a No Push helper and adding PlayerPush = 0 on all the charging states.
=Temoved white Flash FX effects for Ki blasts and Kamehamehas.
=Chou Kamehameha's damage has a different damage dampener (same thing I did for Gohan). 
 No, it's not the new damage dampener that was suggested, I'm still using the old one. 
 I set a variable that keeps count of the hits the Super Kame does 
 and the damage gets scaled because of it, separately from the other attacks.

=The AngleDraw state controllers in the Hyper Rush attacks had commented ignorehitpauses, 
 making the supermove look wrong. Uncommented.
=Hyper Rush: Genkidama finisher fixed
(aura sound effects missing; I used sound 8,5 instead of 8,0 since it's longer).
=Hyper Rush: Angry Kamehameha finisher fixed
(the Kamehameha wouldn't put the enemy in a custom state, so I restored the p2stateno and commented the TargetState).

=Justice mode activation changed from d,d,d+MP+MK to d,d+MP+MK.
=Justice buffer bar consumption added (for Teleport Kamehameha level 1) 
 and slightly changed for the different teleports/zanzoken attacks.
=Reduced damage value of the Teleport Attacks.
=You can't attack the enemy with the same Teleport Attack during a combo.
=Made Teleport Attacks actually useful. They give super meter if you connect 
 and they build up your Justice bar MUCH faster. 
 They do give P2 quite a bit of meter though. Especially if they block it.
=Increased Justice power usage of teleport attacks (no combo) from 1/10 to 1/8.
=Changed teleport attack combo chains to 2 (instead of 3). (Variable 15 in the .cmd)
=Fixed an issue where losing 1000 meter by leaving Justice through teleport happened only once a round.
=Justice Mode doesn't carry over to the next round anymore, whether you win or lose.

=Applied the 'mouth closes after yell ends' frames in the power charge and Justice Mode activaion animations.
=Goku Black palette (made by LightScarecrow, edited by AlexSin) added as 7th (Start + Weak Kick) palette.
=Added MY TOES! sprites and animation (group 5886); sprites color separated by Sin.
=Super KO Background effect added for all supermoves that didn't have it.
=All the winquotes from Goku Z2 are now added into SSJ Goku Z2.
=Added updated sprite 19897,0 (Super KO Background graphic).
=Managed to resolve some Justice bar (blue) graphical bugs.
=Fixed King Kai's antennas in his car crashing winpose.
=The aura effects will stop while in pause/superpause.
=Sounds get properly cut off when skipping intros.
=Dizzy stars moved 30 pixels upwards for Piccolo.
