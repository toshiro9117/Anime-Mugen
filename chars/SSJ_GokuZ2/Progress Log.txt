- Correct voice displayed when SSJ Goku wins Dash Collision.
- Added charging/power-up sound that gets more intense over time to (Air) Chou Kamehameha charge (2400,20).
- Dive Kick has 15 ticks of startup instead of 12, hopefully fixing the infinite (?).
- Altered Cheap KO animation to make him go directly to dead position.
- Removed BlueSun's edit to SSJ Goku's mouth on Perfect winpose, giving him back his gangsta style.
- Added noFG, noBG, noBarDisplay to fatality states.
- Can't airguard anymore if jumping forward or if you have air dashed (fix by Websta in Freeza).
- Changed the cost for Teleport :
	+ 1000 power cost if cancelled from any attack. 
	+ 500 power cost if not cancelled. 
- Added 9 ticks of recovery time to Chou Kmh to avoid comboin into a normal in the corner. This harmonizes it with other Z2 chars.
- Made Teleport Attacks blockable.
- Corrected a bug where Teleport Attacks where performable only twice during a combo.
- In Justice Mode, Teleport Kamehameha adds power to the Justice Bar.

--------------------------------------------
AFTER HDBZ EVO Update :
- Realigned sprite 5020,10
- Added XG's piece of coded to avoid a double KO sound when killed by Vegeta's Royal Edict.
- Updated woosh LK (0,3) / woosh SP (0,2) / impact SP (5,2) sounds.

MEEHHH : 
? OK There are DEFINITELY still connects in his Blast Fists that DON'T give off the hitsound effect. it mostly happens when you're catching a jumping opponent that sounsd are missing.
? After the strong kick command combo, if you perform an OTG after it the opponent can air recover.
- Jump MK > Dive Kick, Focus, LP > HP > HK > HK > Ki Blast x 3, Teleport, repeat. Maximum of 4 loops. Still, it's a 40+ hit combo that requires only 500 power.
? Kamehameha and Chou Kamehameha seem a bit too safe when blocked up close, -1 and +4 frames respectively.
? Ultimate Kmh : I think the delay between the white faded-out screen and showing p2 getting vaporized (when in the last round) can be a bit smaller.


IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE :
? I've also noticed an oddity when you use the throw of certain Z2 characters against Jesuszilla's CvS characters, where if you throw them backwards they'll bounce in the opposite direction when they hit the ground.
? I encountered a strange bug that I can't seem to repeat :do you know when you hit the ground after being hit by a strong kick in the air (p1 and p2 in air), and there is the FX on ground? Well, once I shot some fireballs and that FX followed the blast, even when I taunt that FX followed the Kinton; again, I don't know how I did that.
? I was P1 and my cousin was Vegita Z2. I believe he did his hop forward kick, I blocked it, and got stuck in block. I was definitely stuck in block. He could jump over without me turning and no button presses were working. We only got one round in because of Easter. I'm not sure if he did the hop back go forward kick, or just the forward one. I believe it was the special move though. They fight fast and when it happened we were a little stunned.

UNABLE TO FIX :
- Ex Ki Blast > Chou Kmh as P2 hits the wall causes debug flood


TODO :
- Warp Chou Kamehameha
- Add new palettes, but need to invert them first ...


FEEDBACK :
? You need to add the overlay sprites for his eye pupils in his normal form for Genkidama (so that they are black/darker).
? Sometimes when using Teleport during combos after three Ki Blasts, the counter message will pop up during the combo. I can't find an ironclad way to trigger it, though.

- While using the ultimate Kamehameha against a character I found that if the beam doesn't make contact initially he just gets stuck in an infinite loop.
- Le petit problème du P2StateNo/HitOverride est toujours là et affecte l'EX Ki Blast, le Boomerang Kick, le Focus Smash et les Teleport Attacks (entre autres, je suppose
- If you have Vegeta's voice set to Japanese and you use Goku's Genkidama finisher on him then the voice he makes when he hits the ground is still English.

SSJ Goku 100% combo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exF3R_qppEQ&feature=youtu.be
For SSJ Goku i think the most important thing is to limit his shoryuken to like 3 per emo combo. or 2 even. the 3rd would whiff or twist KO p2 so you cant juggle them anymore afterwardfs.

- If that's the case, then the number of teleports that can be done during Justice Mode should be reduced.  Since a normal teleport costs 1000 power, and I get 10 teleports for 2000 power (in Justice Mode), it's more reason for me to exploit it.  As soon as I get 2 levels of meter, I can just turn on Justice Mode and go to town.  SSJ Goku builds meter at a decent rate, so even if I finish Justice Mode, it won't be hard to get 2 more meters and do it over again.

- Giving SSJ Goku another optional teleport command in B, D, DB would give the teleport a bit more utility especially when trying to land Justice Mode combos. The D, D command wasn't coming out as fluidly as you'd think a command like that would. Part of that may have something to do with extenuating circumstances such as the character, the controller or even MUGEN itself. On top of that when I was attempting to cancel into a teleport is that I had a hard time buffering into the command for easier use (i.e LK, MK, HK, D+HK, D+MP+HP). I was able to finally figure out the timing but I still feel having B.D.DB as the command would be a better fit for the character and it wouldn't be a strange command to have linked to a teleport seeing as characters like Bison & Dhalsim have it and even Goku did as well in Hyper Dimension.
- Whether to leave it as 2 button press or have it work more like Psylocke's in the versus series where each button determines where the teleport goes is a whole other story. That could be optional as well.
- My only other suggestion is having the Super Kamehameha function a bit more like a Denjin Hadoken where moving the stick will make the move come out faster. It would become a greater tool for combo enders with more damage before they fall out of range or to have more functionality after your opponent has been knocked down to give them something to deal with on wakeup.
