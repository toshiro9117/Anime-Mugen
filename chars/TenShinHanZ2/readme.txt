Alex Sin is coding TenShinHan Z2



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update xx/12/2018

- Now when Tenshinhan is doing any low volleyball attacks, he has the statetype fixed to C (Crouching). 
- Added a red CLSN box on Hunting Crane.
- Crouching attacks don't make infinites (OTG fix).
- Altered state 5020 (now found in override.cns). In all cases TenShinHan should display the low get hit animations while in the air.
- If TenShinHan gets hit by a Cinematic move and Chiaotzu is still doing his action, Chiaotzu will teleport away immediately.
(fixed the telekinesis effect that stayed in the screen for a bit of time)
- Copied and pasted the guard states from PiccoloZ2. You can find them in the override.cns.
- The Z counters now don't give power back.
- j.HK makes the opponent fall down while airborne.
- j.MP makes the opponent fall down when performed after a j.LK or j.LP 
(the j.MK1 and j.MK2 don't make the opponent fall on purpose so you can do more combos).
- Fixed HCF/B explods/commands.
- All palettes added.
- Changed small portrait (courtesy of Toni).
- Chiaotzu's Sacrifice now can be perormed when the OM bar is LVL 2.
- Now Tenshinhan talks (mouth sprites added) in the Forgiveness winpose.
- Now Chiaotzu will use 750 points of power for his moves. I tried to make it so that when the enemy was hurt (in a combo) it would consume 1000, but what about when the enemy is lying down or throwing? It would cause problems.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 08/12/2018

- Time Out when performing Shiva Cage fixed.
- Now if you skip the pre battle for any round when Tenshinhan has the OM mode activated you won't see Chiaotzu.
(It was fixed by making two calling helpers, one without the OM, the other with it)
- Added control in some of the air basics (j.LP, j.MP, j.LK, j.MK)
- Simplified Volley ball stance from hold DF,z to DD,z.
- Added bar for the OM mode.
- Z counter changed from FF, 2 punches or FF, 2 kicks to F, 2 punches or F, 2 kicks.
- Now he can't combo from throws using Kikoho.
- Now Tenshinhan talks (mouth sprites added) in the Students winpose.
- Now Chiaotzu's Dodonpa isn't unguardable when close to the enemy. Also changed how it behaves and it stays longer in the screen.
- When Chiaotzu is out or almost out of screen, the marker with his face will appear on the screen.
This appear only when fighting (no intro / ending).
It will be positioned lower for  P1, higher for P2.
This marker does not appear when: 
_Tenshinhan is on OM mode;
_in the cinematic supers;
_during Chiaotzu's sacrifice.
- Now Telekinesis reset the juggle point for more possible combos.
(sometimes it happened that some attacks whiffed when doing combos and when the Telekinesis connected)
- Inoshikacho intro added.
- AI Done (used Gohan, Normal Vegeta and Piccolo as reference).
- Fixed some ChangeState codes in the throws.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 26/11/2018

- Intro problem (camera) with Chiaotzu fixed.
- Time Out when doing Chiaotzu sacrifice (Exit OM mode) fixed.
- Now Chiaotzu sacrifice (Exit OM mode) uses 2000 of power.
- Chiaotzu: voices in the intro. They will be removed if you skip them.
- "Hold!" screams Tien as Chiaotzu paralyzes the enemy. I mean, that's what I added to the character.
He can't talk when Chiaotzu is going to do Telekinesis.
- Time Out when doing Ungrounded fixed.
- Lowered the explosion sound volume of the LVL 2 finisher (last Dodonpas).
- LVL Markers OM mode added.
- Hop! (Volleyball serve) infinite removed.
- Now he can't guard when dashing back (ground).
- Removed screenbound for all of Chiaotzu's actions. (test) How do you feel about this?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 20/11/2018


- Throw tech done.
NOTE: All Character that choose the dash collision tech are bugged. Not only Tenshinhan, but everyone.
To fix that, you'll have to use a SelfState for the statedef 899 instead of a ChangeState, since it's against Z2 characters.
- Camera effect for the big objects lowered a bit.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 11/11/2018

- Now TenShinHan uses one finger for the Dodonpa lvl 1, 2 fingers for the Dodonpa lvl 2.
- Added "big fish" (shaking) and "shark" (chewing) sound.
- Added camera effect for the big objects.
- Explod Buffer done.
- Removed Funimation voices, added custom voices.
TenShinHan = Mike Varker
Chiaotzu = Jared J. Lee (Alpha Proto)










---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 04/11/2018

- Added voices for his basic attacks.
- Increased volume for the Dodonpa voice clips.
- Added intro and winpose voices.
- Crane stance (QCF + kick) now isn't an attack: changed MoveType from Attack to Idle so that the enemy doesn't guard for no reason.
- Wings can make the opponent stand (forcestand = 1).
- Finisher LVL 3 (Shin Kikoho): no music plays when the enemy is defeated.
- Dying scream added.
- Aura charge voice clip added.
- Added guard damage to Hunting Crane.
- Added very small stage compatibility with Tien's "object kicking" intro. If you're on these stages:
"Korin's Tower"
"Neko Majin´s gathering"
"Kami's Lookout"
"Kami's Lookout (Eclipse)"
"Space"
you won't hear the object bouncing/hitting the ground after it falls.
- Added many submissions from the Tien kicking intro contest, all thanks to the guys in the HDBZ Discord and Mugen Guild.
- The start of J.LP is faster, now it's easier to combo. (from 9 ticks to 6)
- Dodonpa now uses one finger at the start-up (thanks Toni). The old frame is still in the .sff.
- Fixed shading for the Flip KO animation sprites.

Buffer is what you're waiting for. I've implemented it for the most part, now the only thing missing is adding it for Chiaotzu, the specials and the supers.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 26/09/2018


- OM points: from 60 OM points (20-40-60) to 90 (30-60-90).
- Now when doing OM attacks, the character flashes; this tells you OM points are added:
3 points for basics and specials;
7 points for taunts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 16/09/2018

- Dodonpa charge (Finisher 2) sound changed.
- Spiral Kick coded.
Two versions: one during the Talons combo, one for the pose (OM mode).
Command: Up + any kick button.
And yes, it hits Gotenks.

- Added some graphical effects for the Finisher 3 - Shin Kikoho, now he'll have some electric charges around. It seemed too empty before.

- Ripping off shirt&pants coded. Two versions, one with and one without polka dots.
It may happen when you have your life lower than 300 points.

- Added Giran and Veku as objects for the object kicking intro.

- Fixed OTG bug. Changed states 5100 and 5110 to be redirecting states and added states 5102 and 5111 (which were the previous 5100 and 5110), so Krillin's forward throw bug doesn't happen anymore.
You could mash buttons to recover much faster/becoming invincible, which is a Mugen built-in characteristic.

- Stupid oversight, finishers don't give power back to Tien now.

- Removed voice choice in the config.txt file, I don't care if you want it back. It's not going to happen.
The new voices still have to be added in the correct places though and I'll have to replace the old ones.
Get hit voices are already in there.

- OM point system implemented.
3 points for each target combo hit (it must hit), 7 for each pose (QCF, any kick; directional buttons+start).
Needs further testing.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 29/08/2018

- Winpose: "ripping off shirt" added.
- Winpose: "Shalom pose" added
- Ungrounded now can be used in a combo.
- Ungrounded is faster and can hit Buu while he walks forward Tien.
- Shin Kikoho finished, added M.Vegeta's ground for the winpose. It'll look terrible in the Mountain Road stage, but who cares.
- Added up + punch for Talons rekka.
- Ungrounded can't be done in team mode and/or against saibamen. Same for the OM mode activation.
- Chiaotzu should move a bit better when close to Tien.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 13/08/2018

- Finisher 2 (Double Dodonpa) coded.
- Volleyball intro (with volleyball sprites made by me) coded.
- Meditation intro (with Chiaotzu meditating sprites by me) coded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 31/07/2018

- Finalized the Finisher 1 - Volleyball Smackdown with sounds and fixes all around.
- After Ungrounded it shouldn't be possible to activate the OM mode otherwise the enemy will get dizzy - fixed.
(actually it would be very very hard to do, but to be sure...)

- Chiaotzu's position when he leaves must be off-screen (always) - adjusted.
- Hover mode must be done only once per combo - done.

- Started Volleyball match (15-07-2018)
Finished Volleyball match (22-07-2018)
- Implemented throw tech for the forward throw, so buggy!!! So for now it's commented and it won't be used.
- Air dashes modified even more so that if you hold the forward/back button you can fly more. (OM mode)
- Added other 4.5 and 5.0 fixes to Tien.





List of things to do:

- juggle system

triggerall = Var(18) <= 15

Done.

This has to be done for supers too. (maybe?)

- Air dashes will cover more space in OM mode.
- Chiaotzu's shield move will behave differently now.

- Chiaotzu comes back after the move Ungrounded ended. (not finished)
- Started coding Chiaotzu's Sacrifice.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 20/05/2018

- c.HK CLSN adjusted so it can hit small characters, like Gotenks. Hitspark position fixed.
- c.LP CLSN adjusted so it can hit small characters, like Gotenks. Hitspark position fixed.
- Changed the forward throw CLSN to have a little less range. I wouldn't want to mess that up though.
If anyone's going to ask, the back throw attempt CLSN is like that on purpose: if I had it look the same as the s.LK (close) it would have had too much range and so the forward throw would've been basically useless.
- Fixed landing state from getting up state: nothitby missing, now it's added.
- Added some flair to the Students winpose. (full screen effect, sound effect)
- Width for standing, stand to crouch and crouching states.
- Removed s. back HK.
- Removed "mash punch button" Shiyoken.
- Reduced amount of ticks for jump start animation.
- Removed ability to charge power while the enemy is paralyzed.
- Made sure Chiaotzu can't do more than one action per combo.  [var(10) for Chiaotzu only]
- Fixed wrong colours in Chiaotzu's skin.
- Juggle points on basic attacks fixed. (7 for standing and crouching, 2 for aerial attacks; custom juggle system, like in Piccolo) var(18)
- Added invulnerability to Super Wings Attack.
- Added Meditation elements. He uses the same state but will show them randomly.
- Changed get hit animations for aerial basic attacks (all attacks will use the "Low" get hit while in the air).
- Tien will be able to do two aerial combos.
- Changed frame data for basic attacks.
- Changed Levitation command from UU (Up, Up) to QCB_p (D,B, any punch). Also possible on ground.
- Jump start from 4 frames to 3.
- Juggle points maxed out during throw.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 23/04/2018

- Chiaotzu winpose (waving hand) added.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 22/04/2018

- Changed sprites for Crane stance (fighting, not winpose).
- Costume intro finished.
- Students winpose finished (beta).
- Crane stance has its own state  (also it's a bit slower).
Change command to QCF, any kick button.
Follow up attacks: F+punch (Energy attack); F+kick (overhead attack). This is also possible after the Talons rekka.
- Changed Ungrounded command to QCBx2, any kick. Changed final hits and some hitsounds.
- Changed custom state lying on ground time for OM mode back throw.
- Chiaotzu comes back after Ungrounded (still buggy).
- Ungrounded costs Lvl2 when in Emo mode and Lvl3 outside.
- Ungrounded doesn't give back power.
- Transition from intro to stand given to Chiaotzu.

Found bug: s.HK in the corner -> Dodonpa lvl 1 (lvl 2 too?) -> beam isn't bound to Tien. This is because of the pushback the heavy kick causes.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 15/04/2018


(Bravery mode => OM mode)
- Fixed AssertSpecial for Backbreaker.
- Backbreaker uses the Z2 broken back standard animation for Z2 characters. Needs testing for all characters.
- Backbreaker makes Tien jump instead of teleporting (first concept).
- (RawkHawk's ideas) Added cancelability: after Talons, you can go into Volley stance.
- (RawkHawk's ideas) Added Crane stance (Down, Down, Down); also after any standing attack you can go into Crane stance.

- Edited Ungrounded more. Used Gohan's Masenko charge FX as hitsparks, made it so you can only hear one hitsound and see one hitspark. Finished for the time being.
FOR THE MOMENT Ungrounded uses the D,D,y+b command and you can use it to cancel the Emotion mode.
We know it's not going to be like that, but we'll have to decide its new input.

- Added comboability: Shiyoken (mash punch buttons) can be done after any non-aerial basic attack. Still pondering on whether or not it could be useful or cool, or not...



- Fixed bounce custom state redirection for a.HP.
- Added comboability: Air Hunting Crane (also EX version) can be done after any aerial attack.
- The Dodonpas' damage dampener has been edited a bit.
- Changed big portrait.

- (only available for Bravery mode) Back breaker can be cancelled from Shiyoken after 13 hits and before 18 hits (of Shiyoken, of course).
- Changed Z Counter - punch.
- Changed VelSets for the aerial medium kicks. Hopefully they'll make the combos easier to perform.
- Coding Ungrounded Lvl 3. Not finished. If you want to test it, have 3 bars of power and press Start.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 4/03/2018

- Focus attack effects sprite priority fixed.

- (only available for Bravery mode) Buddha's Rise (up a.HP) coded.
- (only available for Bravery mode) Wings are now Bravery mode only.
- (only available for Bravery mode) Fast Shiyoken added. Keep pressing the punch buttons. The buttons you choose determines the initial distance Tien covers and the speed of the attacks.
- Tweaked the back throw for the Bravery mode.
- Fixed bug: if Tien is moved by p2 while shooting a Dodonpa, the beam isn't bound to Tien.
- Bravery Mode activation looks better than before now. Tien now talks and Chiaotzu doesn't show any bug: if he's doing an action, he'll finish and then he goes away. Everything shall need some tweakings of course, but yeah.







---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 11/02/2018

- Added palettes made by the guys in the HDBZ channel;
AgentofDestiny, NinjaCapybara, likiji123, EthanTheHuman
- Fixed Chiaotzu movement states yet again!

- Cheap KO added.
- Chiaotzu reacts to Cheap KO / Time Over.
- Cursed form sprites-animations added.

- Bravery mode activation. Very buggy.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chiaotzu's eyelines and eyebrows don't share colours with the hat/shoes.
- All palettes updated. Added palette 23.

Also started on the level 3 (clones) but nothing much is really done. I need the sprites to proceed, so it's not available.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 30/11/2017.

- Lose pose added.
- Volleyball Fist (special) now can be done in three separate ways.
You can start with Save!!! and do the others, or start with Serve!!! and end with Spike!!!, or you can just do the Spike!!! attack.
You can fool the enemy with this new tool! :D
The commands are the same:
D+z = Save!!!
z   = Serve!!!
U+z = Spike!!!
- The Volleyball Fist stance has also been sped up.
- Bug from Dodonpa lvl 1 -> lvl2 fixed.

- Hopefully the Dodonpa positioning bug has been fixed.
Instead of directly destroying the helpers, I made them change their state (anim is invisible) and they get removed when the enemy is no longer in a get hit state.
I also removed a BindToRoot / BindToParent present in the helpers.

- Super BG method by JustNoPoint implemented. Use of invisible projectiles with their own ID.

- Shiyoken / Shiva's punishment coded, with sounds ripped from the anime.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added double bounce to Tien's Volleyball Save. This will of course need fixing (the enemy can recover in mid-air).

- Adjusted aura sprites (palette).
If you want to use and/or colour the aura differently use mine! The palette is much more simple and you won't have to worry about shared palettes or stuff like that. Don't take it from Choujin or the other Z2 characters anymore! :D

- Added tall char jump link infinite fix.
- Added poweradd if throw is successful (p1 +180, p2 +35).

- Talons: QCF, any punch (instead of QCB, because of Chiaotzu's Dodompa).
