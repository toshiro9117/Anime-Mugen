					<div class="col-lg-12">Activating Hunger Mode makes Buu tougher and denser!
					This changes a few things, gameplay-wise. <br>
					- At activation, you will see an empty Majin 'M' symbol (which acts as a bar/gauge) added to the screen.
					Its level is indicated by the color that the 'M' gets filled up with: yellow = Lv1, red = Lv2, black = Lv3.<br>
					- Power Charge is replaced by Hunger Charge, which fills up his Hunger Bar.<br>
					- Blocking the enemy's attacks also fills up the Hunger Bar, but only from Level 1 and upwards.<br>
					- Buu gains armor from Level 1 and upwards, indicated by his exhaust of steam.<br>
					- You gain 1 hit of armor at any Level which needs to recharge after hit once. The higher level you're at, the shorter this recharge takes.<br>
					- Getting hit still deals full damage to Buu, but he won't go into hitstun as long as he's got armor.<br>
					- Gain access to the Mega Candy Beam, detailed below.<br>
					- All Supers cost 1 Power Bar meter less to perform but take you out of the mode upon activation.<br>
					- Kill You gains Finishers at the end, there being three variants (Lv1, Lv2, Lv3).</div>

					Hunger Bar and pouring it into this one attack. The Mega Candy Beam is a full-screen attack
					that turns the enemy into a piece of candy. The more your Hunger Bar was filled,
					the longer the enemy is forced to remain a candy. This gives you ample time to
					power up, taunt, take a sip of your drink or think of ways of continuing your attack!</div>
